Modernize packaging to 2026 standards + auto-setup + unified CLI

This is a big refactor that probably should've been multiple commits, but
honestly, I wasn't planning to do all this when I started. One thing led
to another and suddenly we've got a proper Python package instead of a
collection of scripts.

What changed:
- Added pyproject.toml with proper packaging, entry points, and dev extras
- Moved everything to src/autocoder/ package structure (the modern way)
- Created unified CLI that asks what you want (CLI vs Web UI)
- Added auto-setup - runs npm install && npm run build automatically
- Fixed all the import errors from the restructure
- Kept backward compatibility with legacy shims (old scripts still work)

Why this matters:
- pip install -e '.[dev]' now works like a real package
- Entry points (autocoder, autocoder-ui) appear automatically
- One command instead of remembering start.py, agent_manager.py, etc.
- Auto-setup means you don't need to remember 10 setup steps
- Actually maintainable codebase instead of "everything in root"

Breaking changes:
- None! Legacy shims handle backward compatibility

Credits:
- The core agent system, parallel execution, knowledge base, etc. are all
  from the original project. I just modernized the packaging and UX.
