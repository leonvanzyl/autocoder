Project: Minimal FastAPI API (SQLite)
Name: Tiny Tasks API

Goal
- Build a small FastAPI backend with a SQLite DB to validate the Python verification pipeline.

Core Features
1) Health + docs
- GET /health returns { "ok": true }
- OpenAPI docs enabled (default FastAPI).

2) Tasks CRUD
- POST /tasks { title } -> create
- GET /tasks -> list
- GET /tasks/{id} -> detail
- PATCH /tasks/{id} -> update title/completed
- DELETE /tasks/{id} -> delete

3) Persistence
- SQLite file db (local).
- Simple schema migration or “create tables on startup”.

Testing
- Pytest smoke tests for health and CRUD happy path.

Definition of Done
- `pytest -q` passes.
- API starts with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
