Project: Single-game casino affiliate site
Name: Fortune of Dragons Review Hub

Goal
- Build a fast, SEO-focused website that reviews ONE slot game (“Fortune of Dragons”) and promotes it across multiple casinos.
- Homepage is the full game review page (not a generic landing page).

Audience
- Search users looking for “Fortune of Dragons review”, RTP/volatility, best casinos to play it, bonus terms, and strategy tips.

Core Pages
1) Home (Game Review)
- Comprehensive review: gameplay overview, RTP, volatility, max win, paylines, bonus features, themes, pros/cons.
- “Where to Play” casino table (sortable): bonus, min deposit, allowed countries, payment methods, rating, affiliate link.
- FAQ section (with FAQ schema) and “How to play” steps.
- Add JSON‑LD structured data for: Review + FAQ + Breadcrumb.

2) Casinos
- /casinos lists all casinos that offer the game.
- /casinos/[casino-slug] is a casino review page (bonus terms, trust, KYC, payments, pros/cons, steps to play the game there).

3) Blog (SEO Content)
- /blog list with pagination + category/tag filtering.
- /blog/[slug] article pages.
- At least 5 starter articles focused on this game + casinos + responsible gambling + bonuses.
- Include internal-linking blocks (“Related guides”) and an author box.

4) SEO Tools (internal utilities)
- /tools/meta-generator: generates title/description/OG/Twitter cards for a given page/topic.
- /tools/schema-generator: generates JSON‑LD for Review / FAQ / Breadcrumb using form inputs.
- /tools/serp-preview: live SERP snippet preview for title/description.
- Tools must run locally (no external APIs required).

SEO Requirements
- Clean URLs, canonical tags, robots meta, and sitemap.xml + robots.txt.
- OpenGraph + Twitter cards on all pages.
- Strong internal linking between game review, casinos, and blog.
- Performance: prioritize Core Web Vitals (avoid heavy client JS where possible).

Data Model (local, simple)
- Store casino and game data in local JSON/TS modules (no database required).
- Casino fields: name, slug, rating, bonus_text, bonus_terms_url, min_deposit, countries_allowed, payments, affiliate_url.

Compliance / Safety
- Prominent Responsible Gambling disclaimer in footer + dedicated /responsible-gambling page.
- “18+” indicator and clear affiliate disclosure.

Tech Preferences (suggested, but flexible)
- TypeScript + a modern SSR/SSG framework (e.g., Next.js) OR a lightweight SSG (e.g., Astro).
- Minimal dependencies; include lint + typecheck; add at least one smoke test if feasible.

Definition of Done
- Site runs locally with a single command and renders all core pages.
- SEO metadata and JSON‑LD present on relevant pages.
- Casino table and blog content render correctly.
- Tools pages work and produce copy/paste output.
